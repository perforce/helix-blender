                             Release Notes for
                            Helix Blender Add-on

                              2024.1 Release

Introduction

    The Helix Blender Add-on enables artists and designers to work with Helix 
    Digital Asset Management (DAM) without the need to leave Blender. Helix DAM 
    users can seamlessly version control all their .blend files directly from 
    Blender including navigating DAM projects and collections, reviewing 
    comments on each file version, and downloading/uploading .blend files.

    The add-on requires a connection to a Helix Core Server, active Helix DAM
    license(s), and an existing installation of Helix Sync.

    Perforce numbers releases YYYY.R/CCCCCC. For example, 2012.1/40716.
    YYYY is the year; R is the release of that year; CCCCCC is the
    bug fix change level. Each bug fix in these release notes is
    marked by its change number. Any build includes (1) all bug fixes
    of all previous releases and (2) all bug fixes of the current
    release up to the bug fix change level.
